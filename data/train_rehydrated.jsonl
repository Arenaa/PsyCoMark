But the numbers could be accurate.) \n Feb 8, 2021 - China's hedge funds, which are smaller in size and less famous than their competitors from the Wall Street, have become a stronger money-making force and attracting more assets in 2020, data released ahead of the Chinese Lunar New Year said. The nearly 15,000 funds offered by Chinese money managers returned 30 percent on average in 2020, with the best-performers surging 10-fold, which dwarfs the average 12 percent gain for hedge funds globally, according to data from Simuwang.com, a Chinese financial-data provider, the Bloomberg reported.

It's a fault line, where one part of the Earth enters the other. Most of the time, this happens smoothly, as if Barry White were playing in the background. But every once in a while, our douche of a planet likes to get rough and America rejects the incoming plate. This is called a full-margin rupture, and it's as devastating as it sounds. The last time that happened was in 1700, and the earthquake was so big that it caused a giant tsunami that destroyed a bunch of coastal Japan across the ocean.\nThe Pacific Northwest is all but due for one of these, and it couldn't be more terrifying. When the next one happens, at roughly around a 9.0 (re: very bad) on the Richter scale, cities like Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland are in for what's been described as the worst natural disaster in the history of North America. FEMA projects 13,000 dying, one million homeless, and 2.5 million needing food. Or roughly five to six Katrinas. And that's not even counting Canada. \n -San Francisco's Hayward Fault Gets An Earthquake Every 140 Years ...

And it's not just Mumbai, either -- cities like Chennai are going to have major floods in the next several years, too. \n -The New Madrid Fault May Take Out 150 Miles Of The Midwest \n Way back in 1811 and 1812, when America was still experiencing odd growth spurts and constantly arguing with its mother, a series of over 1,000 earthquakes rocked the Mississippi River between St. Louis and Memphis. One was so powerful that it caused the river to run backwards for a few hours. Another was felt all the way on the East Coast. The epicenter of the quakes was the town of New Madrid, which might as well have been renamed New New Madrid, because it took years to rebuild it. \n Today, the affected cities sit peacefully on the mighty Mississippi -- despite that pesky 40 percent chance that a New-Madrid-level quake could hit in the next few decades. \n \n Earth is due for an \u201cextinction-level\u201d event from the sky \n \n ..and even if we see it coming, we won\u2019t be able to do anything about it, a NASA scientist said Monday. \n Speaking at a meeting in San Francisco, Dr. Joseph Nuth of NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center said large asteroids and comets, the type that could wipe out civilization, are extremely rare, but tend to hit \u201c50 to 60 million years apart.\u201d Given that a comet wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago, one could argue that we\u2019re slightly past \u201cdue.\u201d \n \u201cThe biggest problem, basically, is there\u2019s not a hell of a lot we can do about it at the moment,\u201d he added. \n \n We are overdue for a massive Tsunami/Earth quake  to strike the US \n \n A natural disaster of titanic proportions is overdue to strike the U.S., physicist Michio Kaku warns. \n Seismologists predict it will be the worst natural disaster in North American history, and the federal government estimates it could contribute to 13,000 deaths and 27,000 injuries. \n \"It's not a question of if, it's a question of when,\" the City University of New York physics professor said Thursday on \"CBS This Morning.\" \n \n New York, which is actually riddled with faults, has a long history of earthquakes: On average, the region has witnessed a moderate quake (about a 5.0 on the Richter scale) every hundred years.
